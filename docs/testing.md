# Testing and evidence

## Current evidence

2026-09-16 environment inspection: macOS 26.6.2, Apple M1 Pro, CLT Swift 6.4,
SDK 27.0. Full Xcode and a valid signing identity were not detected. No system
power settings, login items or privileged services have been changed by this work.

The deterministic session core passes 22 Swift Testing tests (including
parameterized boundary cases), strict swift-format lint and a Release build.
Separate Address Sanitizer and Thread Sanitizer runs also pass the 22 tests.
This covers policy, clock semantics, ownership, simultaneous demands, source
suspension, battery cutoff and revocation. It does not exercise a power backend,
XPC, UI or physical sleep behavior.

## Local commands

With full Xcode selected for the process, from the repository root:

```sh
rtk proxy swift Tools/ProjectTool.swift check
rtk proxy swift Tools/ProjectTool.swift asan
rtk proxy swift Tools/ProjectTool.swift tsan
```

`check` runs whitespace checks, strict formatting, Release compilation and tests
with coverage enabled. `asan` and `tsan` run separate instrumented test builds.
The tool loads Apple's existing Swift Testing macro explicitly when the selected
Command Line Tools contain it in the nested `plugins/testing` directory. It does
not install a framework or modify the toolchain. Ordinary Xcode needs no override.

On the inspected Mac, the Desktop file provider adds Finder metadata to generated
test bundles, which codesign rejects. Keep build output outside that synced folder:

```sh
rtk proxy env LIMITLESS_BUILD_PATH=/private/tmp/limitless-swift-build swift Tools/ProjectTool.swift check
```

Use distinct scratch paths for simultaneous sanitizer builds. Do not disable code
signing or strip security attributes to work around an installation failure.
CLT also emits linker warnings for absent Xcode-style search directories; these
are recorded environment warnings, not evidence that full Xcode was tested.

## Required validation layers

1. Swift Testing for deterministic core policy, transport validation and time.
2. Simulated backend integration for state reconciliation and recovery failures.
3. Real unprivileged command/process lifecycle tests, including interruption.
4. Signed native XPC/ServiceManagement tests on an explicitly authorized Mac.
5. Native UI, accessibility and runtime-log inspection with full Xcode/tooling.
6. The physical release matrix in [requirements.md](requirements.md).
7. Full CI/security and signed/notarized artifact verification before release.

Record commands and real outcomes. A blocked/not-run check is never a pass.
Do not install a helper or change power settings in ordinary unit tests or on an
untrusted PR runner. Do not disable system protections to make tests pass.
