# Testing and evidence

## Current evidence

2026-09-16 environment inspection: macOS 26.6.2, Apple M1 Pro, CLT Swift 6.4,
SDK 27.0. Full Xcode and a valid signing identity were not detected. No system
power settings, login items or privileged services have been changed by this work.

Product code and its executable check commands will be documented as they land.
The upstream Sleepless source passed a type check in a temporary directory; this
does not validate Limitless or closed-lid behavior.

## Required validation layers

1. Swift Testing for deterministic core policy, transport validation and time.
2. Simulated backend integration for state reconciliation and recovery failures.
3. Real unprivileged command/process lifecycle tests, including interruption.
4. Signed native XPC/ServiceManagement tests on an explicitly authorized Mac.
5. Native UI, accessibility and runtime-log inspection with full Xcode/tooling.
6. The physical release matrix in [requirements.md](requirements.md).
7. Full CI/security and signed/notarized artifact verification before release.

Record commands and real outcomes. A blocked/not-run check is never a pass.
Do not install a helper or change power settings in ordinary unit tests or on an
untrusted PR runner. Do not disable system protections to make tests pass.
